Implementation Notes

This repo contains the code for three simulations: States of Matter, States of Matter Basics, and Atomic Interactions.

This was ported from a Java simulation, so some elements of the code look quite "Javaesque".  For example, there are a
number of getter/setter methods that would probably be done using direct access if this had originally been a
JavaScript sim.  There are also a lot of places where inheritance is used that probably wouldn't be done in this way
in a started-from-scratch JavaScript sim.

The code was ported by Actual Concepts initially, then PhET took it over.  Due to this, there is some variation in the
coding style and adherence to coding standards.

Visibility annotations are not complete - this was something that was started during development, and we didn't go
update all portions of the code.
