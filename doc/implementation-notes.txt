Implementation Notes

This repo contains the code for three simulations: States of Matter, States of Matter Basics, and Atomic Interactions.

This was ported from a Java simulation, so some elements of the code look quite "Javaesque".  For example, there are a
number of getter/setter methods that would probably be done using direct access if this had originally been a
JavaScript sim.  There are also a lot of places where inheritance is used that probably wouldn't be done in this way
in a started-from-scratch JavaScript sim.

The code was ported by Actual Concepts initially, then PhET took it over.  Due to this, there is some variation in the
coding style and adherence to coding standards.

So that the code could be written in a general way, there are a lot of places where the term 'molecule' is used where
the associated element could be either a multi-atom molecule or a single atom.

There is a construct that contains the data for all of the molecules being simulated at a given moment.  It is arranged
as a set of arrays with all of the data for all of the molecules, as opposed to an array of molecule objects, each of
which has its own data.  This was done this way in the Java version because the performance was significantly better.
We retained this approach for the JavaScript version.  It's possible that the performance would have been as good for
and array of objects.

Visibility annotations are not complete - this was something that was started during development, and we didn't go
update all portions of the code.
