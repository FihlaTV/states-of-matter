Model Notes for States of Matter
================================

+ For solid water, the sim simplifies the model emphasizing that there is space between the molecules. A resource for
the most common visual for ice structure is http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water/ice1h.html
+ The phase diagrams are shown qualitatively in the sim, to help students get a general understanding of phase
diagrams.
+ The sim is not designed to be used as a comprehensive tool for learning about phase diagrams, instead the focus is on
phases of matter. The small number of particles shown and the simplicity of the underlying models makes it difficult to
map accurately the exact phase to the correct regions of the phase diagram. However, we felt there would be some
benefit to students being exposed to a simplified phase diagram. In the sim, the diagram marker remains on the
coexistence line between liquid/gas or solid/gas (and is extrapolated into the critical region).
+ In atomic interactions, when an oxygen atom bonds with another, the energy has to go somewhere.  In the real world, it
generally goes into the motion of the O2 molecule, but since we can't do that here and keep the O2 on the screen, we
convey the additional energy as vibration of the leftmost molecule.  The energy can be thought of as going into friction
with the pin, if that helps.
